## üåü About the Project

Bharat Stays is a full-stack web application meticulously crafted to replicate the core functionalities of popular online accommodation booking platforms like Airbnb. Its primary goal is to provide users with an intuitive, seamless, and delightful experience for discovering, booking, and managing unique stays. Hosts can easily list and manage their properties, making it a comprehensive solution for both guests and property owners.
This project showcases my ability to build robust, scalable, and user-friendly web applications from concept to deployment.
